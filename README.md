# 🎨 Galleria Slideshow Site

A fully functional **art gallery slideshow website** inspired by the Frontend Mentor “Galleria” challenge.  
It allows users to browse famous artworks, view each piece with detailed information, and open any image in a full-screen overlay.

## 🖼️ Features

- **Interactive Bento Grid** – Displays all 15 artworks as clickable tiles.
- **Slideshow Mode** – Clicking a tile starts a detailed slideshow view with artwork info.
- **Navigation Controls** – “Next” and “Back” arrows to move between slides.
- **Progress Bar** – A dynamic progress indicator showing how far you are in the collection.
- **Overlay View** – Click on any image to see a full-screen zoomed version.
- **Responsive Layout** – Scales gracefully across screen sizes.
- **Smooth Animations** – Includes subtle transitions and zoom effects for polish.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The website starts on the **bento grid** view.
- When a user clicks an artwork, JavaScript dynamically switches to the **slideshow section**, displaying the corresponding piece.
- The **footer updates** with the artwork’s title and artist, and a **progress bar** animates based on the current slide number.
- Clicking the **“START SLIDESHOW”** button also initiates the same sequence.
- Clicking an image opens a **dark overlay** with the enlarged image. Clicking outside it closes the overlay.
